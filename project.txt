Building a comprehensive habit tracker application with the mentioned features from scratch requires several steps. 
Here's a comprehensive, step-by-step process to guide you through the development process:

1. Project Setup:
   - Set up a new Flask project.
   - Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
   - Install Flask, Flask-Login, and other required dependencies.

2. Design the Database Schema:
   - Identify the necessary data models for your application, such as User, Habit, DailyEntry, and MonthlySummary.
   - Define the relationships between the models, such as one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
   - Implement the required fields and attributes for each model, including foreign keys, timestamps, and notes.

3. User Authentication:
   - Integrate Flask-Login for user authentication and session management.
   - Implement user registration and login functionality using Flask-Login.
   - Configure third-party authentication providers like Google and Facebook using their respective APIs.

4. User Interface Design:
   - Create wireframes or mockups to plan the UI layout and flow.
   - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the responsive, minimalist design with a focus on white space and muted colors.
   - Incorporate microinteractions to enhance user experience, such as subtle animations or feedback when interacting with elements.

5. Habit Tracking:
   - Create routes and views to handle habit tracking operations.
   - Implement CRUD operations for habits using the Google Sheets API to store and retrieve data.
   - Validate user inputs to prevent errors, ensuring data integrity.
   - Provide user-friendly error messages and notifications for invalid inputs or failed operations.

6. Daily Habit Progress:
   - Develop routes and views to handle daily habit tracking.
   - Implement form submissions and data processing to record daily entries.
   - Store daily habit progress in the database, associating it with the corresponding user and habit.
   - Provide options for users to add notes or additional information for each entry.

7. Monthly and Yearly Summaries:
   - Calculate monthly and yearly habit summaries based on the daily entries.
   - Generate reports or visualizations summarizing the user's habit progress over time.
   - Implement views to display these summaries in a user-friendly manner.

8. Export to CSV:
   - Allow users to export their habit data to CSV format.
   - Implement a route to generate the CSV file based on user preferences and data filters.
   - Provide the CSV file as a downloadable link or send it via email to the user.

9. Unit and Integration Testing:
   - Set up unit tests using a testing framework like pytest.
   - Write test cases to cover critical functionalities, including user registration, login, habit tracking, and data validation.
   - Create integration tests to ensure the proper integration of different components and third-party APIs.
   - Automate the testing process to facilitate continuous integration and deployment.

10. Optimize Google Sheets Storage:
    - Structure the Google Sheets document to optimize data storage and retrieval.
    - Define the sheet structure and naming conventions to store habit data efficiently.
    - Utilize appropriate APIs and techniques to read and write data to Google Sheets effectively.

11. Deployment:
    - Choose a hosting platform or server for deploying your Flask application.
    - Configure the server environment and dependencies.
    - Set up proper security measures, such as SSL certificates and secure configuration for authentication providers.
    - Deploy your application and test its functionality in the production environment.

Remember to break down each step into smaller tasks and tackle them one at a time. It's essential to continuously 
test and debug your application during development and consider best practices for security and performance. 
Good luck with building your habit tracker application!
